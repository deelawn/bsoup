# Bsoup

A simple exercise using beautiful soup.

>*Note*: Beautiful Soup 3 has been replaced by Beautiful Soup 4. Beautiful Soup 3 only works on Python 2.x, but Beautiful Soup 4 also works on
Python 3.x.  Beautiful Soup 4 is faster, has more features, and works with third-party parsers
like lxml and html5lib. You should use Beautiful Soup 4 for all new projects.
